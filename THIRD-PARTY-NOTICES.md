# Third-party notices

TabStudio is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). It ships with, or downloads on
request, the third-party software below. Each one is under its own licence.

## Inside the APK

| Component | Licence | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PRoot](https://github.com/termux/proot), Termux's fork, 5.1.107.101 | GPL-2.0-or-later | [termux/proot v5.1.107.101](https://github.com/termux/proot/archive/v5.1.107.101.zip) |
| [talloc](https://talloc.samba.org) 2.5.0, linked into PRoot | LGPL-3.0-or-later | [talloc-2.5.0.tar.gz](https://www.samba.org/ftp/talloc/talloc-2.5.0.tar.gz) |
| The Razor compiler from the .NET SDK | MIT | See [src/TabStudio.Compilation/Razor/Compiler/NOTICE.txt](src/TabStudio.Compilation/Razor/Compiler/NOTICE.txt) |
| The fling curve of Android's `OverScroller` (Copyright © 2010 The Android Open Source Project), ported to C# in [FlingSpline.cs](src/TabStudio.App/Input/Scrolling/FlingSpline.cs) | Apache-2.0 | [OverScroller.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/main/core/java/android/widget/OverScroller.java) |
| The NuGet packages in [Directory.Packages.props](Directory.Packages.props), such as Avalonia and Roslyn | Each package's own licence, shown on nuget.org | nuget.org |

PRoot, with talloc linked in, and PRoot's loader are separate programs in the APK (`lib/<abi>/libproot.so` and
`lib/<abi>/libproot-loader.so`), not part of TabStudio's own code. They are built from the unmodified sources above,
checked against pinned SHA-256 hashes, by [build/android/native/build.sh](build/android/native/build.sh), which anyone
can run to rebuild them.
